kafka.server.replica_manager.isr_shrinks_per_sec.count,count,,,,"If a broker goes down, ISR for some of the partitions will shrink. When that broker is up again, ISR will be expanded once the replicas are fully caught up. Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink rate and expansion rate is 0",,confluent_platform,
